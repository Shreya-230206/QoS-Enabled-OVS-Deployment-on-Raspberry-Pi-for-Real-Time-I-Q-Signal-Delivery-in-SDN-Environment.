# QoS-Enabled-OVS-Deployment-on-Raspberry-Pi-for-Real-Time-I-Q-Signal-Delivery-in-SDN-Environment.
This project demonstrates how SDN principles, combined with lightweight hardware like Raspberry Pi, can be effectively used to implement host-based prioritization and traffic control. 
# SDN QoS Tutorial on Raspberry Pi

This repository provides **step-by-step instructions** to set up a QoS-enabled network using:
- **Ryu SDN Controller**
- **Open vSwitch on Raspberry Pi**
- **Flask Web GUI** for monitoring

---

## Steps
1. [Install Ryu Controller](Install_Ryu.md)
2. [Raspberry as an OVS configuration](Raspberry_Configuration.md)
3. [Create Queues for each host](Queue_Creation.md) 
4. [Connect hosts to switch ports](Network_Topology.md)
5. [Dynamic Flows installation with Ryu application](Ryu_Application.py)
	###### This Ryu application is built by extending SimpleSwitch13 and provides dynamic flow installation with QoS queue prioritization for specific hosts in a 	Software-Defined Network (SDN). It retains normal L2 switching behavior (learning switch) and adds special treatment for traffic from a designated host (h2) 	by directing it into a high-priority queue.
	###### Features:
	1. Maintains L2 learning switch behavior
	2. Adds dynamic QoS policy for critical traffic
	3. Ensures priority bandwidth for selected host
	4. Easily extensible for more queue logic or flow types
	###### How it works: 
	1.	Extends SimpleSwitch13: Inherits MAC learning and basic forwarding logic (priority=1 flows).
	2.	Handles Switch Connection: Stores the datapath and installs default table-miss flow (via base class).
	3.	Detects New Hosts: Uses EventHostAdd to react when a new host connects to the switch.
	4.	Checks Server Port (Port 3): Skips flows installation if the host is connected to port 3 (reserved for server), flow rules are meant to prioritize traffic 	going to the server, not from it.
	5.	Identifies Priority Host (MAC 00:00:00:00:00:02)
    	1. Installs a high-priority flow (priority=100)
    	2. Sets traffic to Queue 0 using OFPActionSetQueue
    	3. Forwards traffic to server port (port 3)
	6.	For Other Hosts
    	1. Default SimpleSwitch13 behavior handles them (no queue set).
    	2. Traffic is forwarded based on learned MACâ€“port mappings.
6. [Performance Evaluation](Results.md)
