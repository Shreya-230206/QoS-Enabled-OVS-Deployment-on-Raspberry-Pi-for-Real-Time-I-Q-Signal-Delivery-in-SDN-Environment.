# QoS-Enabled-OVS-Deployment-on-Raspberry-Pi-for-Real-Time-I-Q-Signal-Delivery-in-SDN-Environment.
This project demonstrates how SDN principles, combined with lightweight hardware like Raspberry Pi, can be effectively used to implement host-based prioritization and traffic control. 
# SDN QoS Tutorial on Raspberry Pi

This repository provides **step-by-step instructions** to set up a QoS-enabled network using:
- **Ryu SDN Controller**
- **Open vSwitch on Raspberry Pi**
- **Flask Web GUI** for monitoring

---

## Steps
1. [Install Ryu Controller](Install_Ryu.md)
2. [Raspberry as an OVS configuration](Raspberry_Configuration.md)
3. [Create Queues for each host](Queue_Creation.md) 
4. [Dynamic Flows installation](Ryu_Application.md)

## Repository Purpose
This repository is designed for **beginners** who want to:
- Learn SDN basics
- Experiment with Raspberry Pi as a network switch
- Implement QoS using SDN controllers
